Nachimuthu Gounder implemented an ultimate idea to use bullock carts to help people. The limitations of bullock cart transportation prompted him to modernize and Anamalais Transport came into existence which is now known as ABT limited exploring every corner of the state.   The modernization of the transport fueled a thought on the importance of technical education. A vision was born. The dream was made into reality by Arutchelvar Dr. N. Mahalingam – a name that is synonymous with Pollachi. Motivated by his father’s vision Nachimuthu Industrial Association Trust was established in the year 1956.

The dream was cherished with the incorporation of Nachimuthu Polytechnic College in 1957 through which 120 rural students were made competent enough to work with modern technology.

 As he had a better understanding of the need of the hour Arutchelvar Dr. N. Mahalingam was prompted to pioneer with technical education rather than starting a school.

Within a short span of 50 years the NIA has ventured into many avenues and has established its roots in industrialization, education, finance, transportation, synthetic gems, textiles, agriculture and automobiles.
